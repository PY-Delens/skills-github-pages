Step 4: Create a blog post
GitHub Pages uses Jekyll. In Jekyll, we can create a blog by using specially named files and frontmatter. The files must be named _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md. You must also include title and date in your frontmatter.

What is frontmatter?: The syntax Jekyll files use is called YAML frontmatter. It goes at the top of your file and looks something like this:
---
title: "mytitle1"
date: 2025-11-05
---
For more information about configuring front matter, see the Jekyll frontmatter documentation.
